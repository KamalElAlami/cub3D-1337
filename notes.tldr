for example ila endna fl field of view : 60 degrees
donc khaykun endna almost 320 column = 320 ray 

to calculate distance between rays 60 / 320 hadi hiya bach ghan increament rays diali
 
aweel haja kan subtract  fov/2 bach kanakhud 30 degree lee ela left bach kanbda

kan start at column 0
while (column < 320)
    cast a ray
    trace the ray until it intersects with a wall (map[i][j] == 1)
    record the intersection x,y and the distence (ray length)
    rayangle += 60/320
